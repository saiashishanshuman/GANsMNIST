# GANsMNIST

A light weight GANs made with PyTorch trained to generate images of handwritten digits visually similar to MNIST dataset
-> The neural network is trained for 100 epochs and results would be better if trained for more (under training)
-> Complexity of the network could be increased by increasing complexity of Generator and Discriminator.
